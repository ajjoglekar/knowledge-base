# 🧱 Module 6 — ITIL 4 Practices

---

## 🎯 Goal / Learning Outcome
By the end of this module, you will understand:
- What **ITIL practices** are and why ITIL moved away from the term *process*
- How practices act as **organizational capabilities**
- The **three groups of ITIL 4 practices**
- How practices support value creation across the **Service Value System (SVS)**

> This module builds **awareness and orientation**, not operational mastery.

---

## 📘 What is an ITIL Practice?

> **Definition:**  
An **ITIL practice** is an organizational capability for performing work or accomplishing an objective, enabled by **people, processes, information, and technology**.

### Key shift from ITIL v3 → ITIL 4
- ❌ Old mindset: *Follow the process*
- ✅ New mindset: *Apply the capability based on context*

A practice is **not**:
- A fixed workflow
- A rigid procedure
- A tool-specific implementation

A practice **is**:
- Reusable
- Adaptable
- Context-driven
- Continuously improved

---

## 🧠 Why ITIL Moved from “Processes” to “Practices”

| Processes (Old) | Practices (New) |
|----------------|----------------|
| Step-by-step | Capability-based |
| Rigid | Flexible |
| One-size-fits-all | Context-aware |
| Tool-agnostic but abstract | Tool-enabled and people-aware |
| Hard to adapt | Designed for change |

> 💡 Practices reflect how **modern organizations actually work** — Agile, DevOps, Cloud, and hybrid environments.

---

## 🧩 Practice Groups in ITIL 4

ITIL 4 defines **34 practices**, grouped into **three categories**.

---

### 🏛️ 1. General Management Practices
These practices support **how the organization is run and governed**, not just IT.

**Purpose:**  
Enable effective leadership, planning, risk management, and organizational control.

Examples include:
- Strategy Management
- Risk Management
- Portfolio Management
- Information Security Management
- Continual Improvement

> These practices ensure IT services align with **business goals and governance**.

---

### 🧰 2. Service Management Practices
These practices focus on **designing, delivering, and supporting services**.

**Purpose:**  
Ensure services meet customer needs and deliver value.

Examples include:
- Incident Management
- Problem Management
- Change Enablement
- Service Desk
- Service Level Management
- Release Management

> These are the practices most people associate with “traditional ITSM.”

---

### 🛠️ 3. Technical Management Practices
These practices support **technical execution and infrastructure management**.

**Purpose:**  
Ensure technology is reliable, secure, and fit for purpose.

Examples include:
- Deployment Management
- Infrastructure & Platform Management
- Software Development & Management

> These practices connect ITIL directly to **DevOps and engineering teams**.

---

## 🔄 How Practices Fit into the Service Value System (SVS)

Practices do **not** operate in isolation.

They:
- Support **all Service Value Chain activities**
- Enable **value co-creation**
- Interact continuously with:
  - Guiding Principles
  - Governance
  - Continual Improvement
  - Value Streams

> 📌 Think of practices as **capability engines** that power value creation.

---

## 🏢 NextGen Example — Practices as Capabilities (Conceptual)

> **Scenario:**  
NextGen launches a new digital service.

Instead of “following processes,” NextGen:
- Uses **Change Enablement** to assess risk
- Applies **Release Management** to coordinate deployments
- Relies on **Incident Management** when issues arise
- Improves outcomes via **Continual Improvement**

Each practice is applied **as needed**, at the **right depth**, based on context.

> ✔️ Same practices  
> ✔️ Different execution  
> ✔️ Value-driven decisions  

---

## 📌 What This Module Does *Not* Do (Important)

This module intentionally does **not**:
- Deep dive into each practice
- Explain workflows or tools
- Teach operational execution

> Each practice can be studied **independently later** if deeper mastery is required.

---

## 🧠 Exam & Study Tips

- Know **what a practice is**
- Understand **why practices replaced processes**
- Be able to name the **three practice groups**
- Recognize that practices are **flexible capabilities**, not rigid rules

> Exam questions focus on **conceptual understanding**, not implementation.

---

## 🧠 Memory Box

> **“Processes tell you *how*.  
Practices give you the *ability*.”**

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- ITIL 4 defines **34 practices**
- Practices represent **organizational capabilities**
- They are grouped into **General, Service, and Technical**
- Practices enable **flexible, context-aware value creation**
- Module 6 is an **orientation layer**, not a deep dive


---

## 🏢 NextGen Macro Example — Practices as Capabilities (End-to-End View)

> **Scenario:**  
NextGen is preparing to launch a new customer-facing feature on its digital platform.

Instead of thinking in terms of rigid processes, NextGen activates **relevant practices as needed**.

### 🔹 Before the launch
- **Strategy Management** ensures the feature aligns with business goals
- **Portfolio Management** confirms priority and funding
- **Information Security Management** validates risk exposure

> No workflows yet — just capability alignment.

---

### 🔹 During development and preparation
- **Software Development & Management** supports build activities
- **Change Enablement** evaluates the level of risk for the release
- **Release Management** coordinates when and how the feature is introduced

Each practice is applied **lightly or deeply** depending on:
- Risk
- Speed required
- Business impact

---

### 🔹 After release
- **Incident Management** is ready to restore service if issues occur
- **Service Desk** acts as the single point of contact for users
- **Problem Management** investigates recurring issues
- **Continual Improvement** captures lessons learned

---

### 🧠 Key Observation
NextGen did **not “follow 10 processes”**.

They:
- Selected **relevant practices**
- Applied them as **organizational capabilities**
- Adjusted depth based on **context**

> ✔️ Same practices  
> ✔️ Different intensity  
> ✔️ Value-focused outcomes  

---

### 🎯 Why this example matters
This demonstrates that in ITIL 4:
- Practices are **not mandatory steps**
- They are **toolkits for decision-making**
- Value is created through **appropriate application**, not blind adoption
