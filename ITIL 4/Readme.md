## 🧠 What Makes This Different

Most ITIL material focuses on:
- Definitions
- Processes
- Diagrams
- Exam tactics

This repository focuses on:
- **Why ITIL exists**
- **How it fits modern work**
- **What breaks when concepts are ignored**
- **How decisions ripple across the system**

ITIL is treated as:
> A **reasoning framework**, not a rulebook.

## 🏢 The Running Example — NextGen

All modules are grounded in a single fictional-but-realistic organization called **NextGen**.

NextGen represents:
- A modern, fast-moving, DevOps-oriented organization
- Facing common challenges: speed vs stability, delivery vs trust, autonomy vs alignment

The case is used to:
- Illustrate abstract ITIL concepts
- Show trade-offs and tensions
- Demonstrate how ITIL works *in practice*, not just on paper
