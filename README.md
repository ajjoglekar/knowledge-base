# Knowledge Base

This repository is a curated knowledge base covering **Release Engineering, DevOps, IT Service Management, and Delivery Leadership**.

It captures practical insights, architectural thinking, and real-world lessons from working across enterprise delivery environments — where technology, process, and people must align to deliver reliable outcomes.

This is not a collection of tutorials or copied notes.  
It is a structured record of **how I think about software delivery systems**.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this knowledge base is to:

- Document delivery concepts with real-world context
- Bridge gaps between **process, engineering, and execution**
- Explain *why* systems are designed a certain way — not just *how*
- Create reusable mental models for complex delivery problems

The content here complements hands-on engineering work and focuses on **clarity, safety, and explainability in delivery systems**.

---

## Structure

The repository is organized by domain:
```
knowledge-base/
├─ release-engineering/
├─ devops/
├─ itil/
├─ safe-rte/
└─ assets/
```

Each section contains focused articles, diagrams, and notes relevant to that domain.

## Domains Covered

### 🔁 Release Engineering
Topics related to release strategy, environment promotion, deployment safety, and coordination at scale.

Example topics:
- Release Management and DevOps alignment
- Build pipelines vs release pipelines
- Environment promotion strategies
- Release verification and rollback thinking

---

### ⚙️ DevOps
System-level DevOps concepts focused on reliability and delivery outcomes.

Example topics:
- CI/CD architecture decisions
- GitOps as a delivery control plane
- Automation with intent
- Observability from a release perspective

---

### 🧭 ITIL & IT Service Management
Modern ITSM concepts applied in practical, engineering-driven environments.

Example topics:
- ITIL 4 in real delivery systems
- Service Value System (SVS) explained through engineering workflows
- Bridging ITSM and DevOps without bureaucracy

---

### 🚆 SAFe / Release Train Engineering
Scaled delivery concepts focused on flow, coordination, and leadership.

Example topics:
- The RTE role in practice
- PI Planning as a flow mechanism
- Aligning teams without slowing delivery

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Read individual articles directly from their domain folders
- Use diagrams and examples to understand delivery trade-offs
- Reference concepts during architecture discussions or interviews
- Treat this as a **living knowledge system**, not static documentation

---

## Relationship to Other Work

This knowledge base complements my hands-on engineering projects, including:

- **Hello-Deluxe** — a production-style CI/CD and GitOps system  
  (demonstrating how many of these concepts are applied in practice)

Together, they represent both **execution and explanation**.
