# 🏢 Running Example — NextGen (ITIL 4 Learning Case)

## 🎯 Purpose of This Example
This note defines a **single, consistent example organization** called **NextGen**, which will be referenced across **all ITIL 4 modules**.

The purpose of this running example is to:
- Make ITIL concepts **practical and concrete**
- Help learners connect **theory to real-world situations**
- Ensure ITIL is understood as a **living management approach**, not abstract theory
- Build intuition by applying concepts repeatedly to the same organization

This example is **intentionally realistic, simple, and adaptable**.

## 🏢 About the Organization — NextGen

**NextGen** is a mid-sized, technology-driven organization that provides a **digital, customer-facing platform**.

### High-level characteristics:
- Operates a cloud-hosted application
- Customers depend on the platform for daily activities
- Revenue and reputation are directly tied to service reliability
- Teams release changes frequently
- Incidents and outages have immediate customer impact

NextGen reflects a **typical modern IT environment** where ITIL 4 is highly relevant.

## 🧩 Services at NextGen

NextGen does not deliver “applications” or “systems” — it delivers **services**.

### Primary Business Service
> **Customer Ordering Service**

This service enables customers to:
- Access the platform
- Place and manage orders
- Receive confirmations reliably
- Trust the platform during critical usage periods

### Supporting Services
- Authentication and access service
- Payment processing service
- Monitoring and alerting service
- Infrastructure and platform services

Together, these services enable **end-to-end value creation**.

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced by NextGen (Before ITIL Thinking)

Like many real organizations, NextGen experiences:
- Incidents after frequent releases
- Unclear ownership of end-to-end services
- Teams optimizing for local success instead of service outcomes
- Success measured by deployment completion, not customer impact
- Ongoing tension between speed (DevOps) and stability (Operations)

These challenges make NextGen an ideal case for understanding **why ITIL 4 concepts exist**.

## 🔄 How NextGen Will Be Used Across Modules

The **same NextGen context** will be referenced throughout the ITIL 4 learning journey to explain:

- What a **service** really means (Module 2)
- How **value** is defined and perceived by different stakeholders
- How work flows through the **Service Value System (SVS)**
- How decisions are guided by **ITIL Guiding Principles**
- How the **Service Value Chain** maps to real operational workflows
- How **ITIL practices** (e.g., Incident Management, Change Enablement) operate
- How **continual improvement** is applied over time
- How ITIL aligns with **DevOps, Agile, and Cloud** environments
